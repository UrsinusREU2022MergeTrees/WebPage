        <h1>Computable Metrics Between Chiral Merge Trees</h1>
        <p>
            We start with a fairly innocuous question: How do we train a computer to recognize that a group of real-valued, <b>sampled</b> functions is the same, <b>up to a parameterization?</b>  By <b>sampled</b>, we mean that we've evaluated the function at a sequence of numbers in its domain.  For instance, below are 100 samples of the function <b>cos(2 &pi; t)</b> over the interval <b>[0, 4]</b>
            
        </p>

        <p> 
            By <b>parameterization</b>, we mean that the function can be pre-composed with a monotonically increasing function <b>h(x)</b> as <b>f(h(x))</b>.  For instance, the animation below shows 400 samples of different parameterizations of the function 
        </p>

        <div style="width:100px;">
            <h3>
                \[ f(x) = sin(2 \pi x) + x\]
            </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            on the interval <b>[0, 1]</b>, composed with different monotonic functions <b>h(x)</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Now stare at this picture of a bunch of sampled functions for a moment, and see if you can sort them into different groups, or "clusters"
        </p>

        <div style="padding: 100px;">
            <img src = "TrendingExamplesMixed.svg" width=900>
        </div>


        <p>
            There are actually 4 distinct clusters, as shown below
        </p>

        <div style="padding: 100px;">
            <img src = "TrendingExamples.svg" width=900>
        </div>

        <p>
            But how can we train a computer to discover that when all we're given is 400 numbers?

        <h2>Approach #1: Dynamic Time Warping</h2>
        <p>
            One popular numerical approach to compare functions is known as dynamic time warping.  It works to explicitly uncover the optimal parameterization to best align two functions
